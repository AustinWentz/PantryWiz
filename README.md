# PantryWiz
The process of finding a delicious recipe only to find out that you don’t have over half the
ingredients to make it can prove frustrating. With our webapp, individuals will be able to search
for recipes based on ingredients they already have, allowing them to try new foods without have
to take a costly trip to the grocery store. Users will be able to choose from a set of pre-existing
ingredients and will receive recipes from the web at varying levels of compatibility with the
ingredients they’ve chosen. Our webapp will also allow for users to create an account and save
recipes, a feature that is not offered by similar websites.
